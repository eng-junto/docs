Engineering Junto Manifesto

Startups are islands of experience in a sea of misinformation.

We want to build amazing software. But too much time is sucked away trying out Open Source or SaaS solutions. Encountering undocumented “features”, lurking in chat rooms to pounce on a “contributor” (that mythical creature), discovering that you’re the biggest customer (by an order of magnitude) and they never told you… The Google search box becomes your best friend. StackOverflow contributors are your gods. That guy Tony your VP knows at Docker (or Twitter, or Cloudera, or…) is your savior.

What if there was a better way?

We’re forming the Engineering Junto to solve this problem. Our goal: an ambassador (or two) from the world’s greatest startups. People who’ve been there, done that, from companies pushing the limits of scale. Folks who love to build systems.

Engineers who want to help each other build better software - and waste less time.

You’re here because somebody believes you belong in this club. This is not a large commitment, but there are rules and expectations. We can’t let the group become too large because that defeats the purpose; we can’t let the conversations peter-out because that defeats the purpose; we can’t have random, easy questions because that defeats the purpose. Our rules:

Keep conversations engineering-centric.
No questions that can be answered by Googling in <30 minutes.
Must be an active Ambassador of the community: regularly answer questions, route questions to/from your company, participate in events.
Be open to learn from others and will speak honestly about your experiences.

Finally, since we’re all about iterating & failing fast… The rules will change (but the purpose will not!). We’ll adapt as we figure out how to build a successful community.

Thanks for joining.

Dobromir, Olivier, Peter, Christophe, and Chris
