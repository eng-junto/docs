Speaker/Topic
For the next event we are doing a talk/discussion with Ben Sigelman on the topic of Latency Measurements. Below is a short description of the talk + a short bio about Ben. After his talk we will have ample time for questions and discussions about the topic between everyone who attends.
 
Talk info:
We all know that latency is of the utmost importance for user-facing internet services, and we all know that it’s necessary to measure it. That said, the way most companies measure latency is flawed. That’s because proper latency monitoring is tricky and seemingly expensive. While working on Google’s next-gen timeseries monitoring system, my team uncovered a few surprising techniques and observations that make high-fidelity, fine-grained, flexible latency measurements affordable. In this talk I’ll describe some of these learnings and do my best to answer questions about same.
 
Bio on Ben:
Ben is a cofounder at Resonance Labs, an early-stage company working to change the way that developers build, understand, and interact with distributed systems. Ben spent nine years at Google where he led the design for several large (~1M-process) distributed systems including Dapper, an always-on distributed tracing system; and Monarch, a high-availability timeseries collection, storage, and query system.
